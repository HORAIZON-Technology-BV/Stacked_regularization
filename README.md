This repository implements a stacked model architecture using ExtraTreesClassifier in a stratified shuffle split cross-validation setup. The model is designed to select top features from multi-omics data, followed by Bayesian optimization to fine-tune the model parameters for enhanced performance. This pipeline also calculates permutation feature importance and evaluates model performance with ROC-AUC scoring.
